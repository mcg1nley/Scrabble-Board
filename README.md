# Scrabble-Board
A customisable scrabble board. Users can select how big the board is
Users will have a choice of a starter word which will go in the middle of the board
Users will have a list of pre-created words 
The idea is that you should be able to see where the pre created words could all fit in together.

Could turn this in to a game to see if people can put together random words
