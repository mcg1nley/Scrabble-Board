# Scrabble-Board

The idea is that the user can create their own customisable board. Like the ones that can be found [here](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/957312156/personalised-scrabble-frame-up-to-18?gpla=1&gao=1&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_uk_en_gb_-home_and_living&utm_custom1=_k_CjwKCAjw8JKbBhBYEiwAs3sxNxc9nGeOj0qb4-YkB_ElNsgAPDY1dkg1oD0s0ts9pp85hcDPHHDHchoCi1MQAvD_BwE_k_&utm_content=go_14821442085_125173007022_549119977872_pla-303628061699_c__957312156engb_118543039&utm_custom2=14821442085&gclid=CjwKCAjw8JKbBhBYEiwAs3sxNxc9nGeOj0qb4-YkB_ElNsgAPDY1dkg1oD0s0ts9pp85hcDPHHDHchoCi1MQAvD_BwE)

- Users should be able to select how big the board is.
- Users should be able to select a starting word eg. "FAMILY"
- User can select how many other words they want
- Users can input those words
- Users should then be able to move the words around to see how they could all fit in together
- The standard rules of Scrabble should apply. i.e words can share a letter but if two letters are next to each other and don't create a word then it should not be valid
- I would like to implement a click and drag system so that users can select the word they want to fit and drag it on to the board
- It should be obvious to the user whether they can fit a word somewhere, and it should be impossible for them to place a word that does not fit
